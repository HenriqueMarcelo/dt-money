# DT Money

The "DT Money" project was developed during Rocketseat's "Ignite" course, with the goal of creating a finance management web application using the React library.

During the development of the project, several technologies and concepts important for the development of modern web applications were used.

## Technologies

Libraries were used such as:

- Axios: library for performing HTTP requests;
- React Hook Form: library for manipulating forms in React in a simple and efficient way;
- Zod: library for validating data in TypeScript;
- Radix: library for creating components focused on accessibility;
- Styled Components: library for styling components in React;
- Eslint: tool for keeping code organized and consistent;
- Json Server: library for simulating a REST API for development.

## Concepts

Besides the libraries mentioned above, the project also used several important concepts, such as:

- Context API: React's feature to share data between components without the need to manually pass properties;
A- PI REST: architecture standard for building web APIs;
- Forms: ways to build forms in web applications;
- Data validation: ensure that the data entered by the user is in the correct format and within the business rules of the application;
- Data formatting: ensure that the data is presented in a consistent and understandable way to the user;
- TypeScript: programming language for JavaScript that adds static typing features and other functionality to increase code quality and developer productivity.

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/HenriqueMarcelo/ignite-timer.git```
2. Go to the project folder:
```cd ignite-timer```
3. Install the dependencies:
```yarn```
4. Run the test server:
```yarn dev-server```
5. Run the project:
```yarn dev```

## Conclusion

The "DT Money" project is a great example of how to use these technologies and concepts to build a modern and efficient web application.
